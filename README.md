# Component Playground POC

An experiment with using USWDS SVGs to create a browser-based playground anyone can use to mock up ideas.

- Uses Jquery UI at the moment.
- Uses a draggable div with an object reading in SVGs inside it.
- Selectable/draggable area is to the left of the object.
- Object is still selectable at the moment.
